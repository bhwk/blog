# Blog site
This site exists because I wanted to try out using Prisma and Supabase together.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```git
git clone https://github.com/bhwk/blog.git
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
npm i
yarn add
pnpm install
```

Remember to setup your .env file:

```
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL
```

For more information on Prisma's environment variables checkout this [page](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/development-environment/environment-variables).

## Enjoy!
